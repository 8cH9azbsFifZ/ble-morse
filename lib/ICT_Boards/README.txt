README - ICT-Boards by In-Circuit

To add support to your Arduino IDE for all Arduino-Boards provided by In-Circuit, just follow these steps:

(1. Download & install Arduino IDE 1.0.5r2 --> get it at http://www.arduino.cc/ )

2. Locate your local Arduino-Sketches folder. Common paths are:

	C:\Dokumente und Einstellungen\user\Eigene Dateien\Arduino
	C:\Documents and ...\Arduino

3. Copy the folders 'hardware' and 'libraries' into that Arduino-sketches folder.

4. All supported ICT-Boards are available within your Arduino IDE now.

5. Choose your board via Sketches->Board and upload your Sketch.


Several examples for each ICT-Board are now available via File->Examples->ICT
